# AtomicKube
Kubernetes Cluster Deployment on Atomic Host

This project aims for automated deployment of Kubernetes Cluster on Atomic Host based machines in OnPromise (InHouse) infrastracture.

Assumptions: 
  You are going to deploy one of CentOS/RedHat Atomic Host boxes as your runtime.
  You, possibly, don't have an access to Internet (in fortified Proxy/Firewall environment).
  You do have an InHouse Docker Repository, such as Nexus OSS|Pro or Artifcatory Pro or other.
  You have an InHouse Git Repostory such as GitLab/BitBucket or (my personal preference) GitBucket.
  (Optional) You have JenkinsCI or other CI tool supporting Docker Slaves.

The work is under going.
